# IMBOREDD

## Overview
This is a repository full of all of the code I used to solve a series of programming puzzles in a competition that I'm not actually in but heyo, what can you do? All of the problems are from the site [Kattis, Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/). Each of the problems is separately linked.

The repo is all under an MIT licence so feel free to do whatever you want with the code, not that useful anyways.

## Completed Problems

### [Problem A - Batmanacci](https://open.kattis.com/problems/batmanacci)

#### Overview

This problem featured the Batmanacci sequence which is a string concatenation version of the Fibonacci sequence so it looks like this: \[\'N\', \'A\', \'NA\', 'ANA\', \'NAANA\', \'ANANAANA\', ...\] and continues to an infinite number of terms. For more information on the sequence see the [original challenge](https://open.kattis.com/problems/batmanacci). The idea of the challenge is that the program is given 2 numbers; the first one, N (1≤N≤10^5), signals that term of the Batmanacci sequence and the second, K (1≤K≤10^18), refers to a specific character in the term defined by N. The tasks is to determine what the character, defined by the inputs N and K, is.
